Please see [the screenshot](ITPII.pdf) as the first version of design.

I have completed the layout modifications for the draw app. Various buttons and tools have been relocated to the top of the page, while a new status bar has been added below. The central area is now dedicated to providing users with ample space for drawing, a design choice I believe to be more logical.

I have changed the icons for the buttons, sourcing them from https://www.svgrepo.com/. I aim to use flatter and more abstract icons from this source to replace the original icons, creating a cleaner and more streamlined appearance.

Also I added a `color picker` using the `createColorPicker` method from p5.js. Implemented it in a separate file, colourPicker.js, and initialized it in sketch.js
