I plan to enhance the functionality by adding tools like oval, text, rectangle, and eraser and so on.
Offering a diverse set of options for users. Moreover, I aim to design a color picker, leveraging the convenient feature provided by p5.js. As part of the design, I intend to treat the stroke of the shapes as a distinct global attribute, enabling users to easily customize and set preferences. This approach enhances user experience, providing flexibility and control over the graphical elements. All these features will be organized systematically, with each tool contributing to a comprehensive and user-friendly UI. The implementation is structured across different files, promoting modularity and maintainability in the codebase
