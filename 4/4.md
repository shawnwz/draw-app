Currently, my UI design is inspired by https://paintz.app/. I find its design to be clean and suitable for our project's requirements. 
As for the code, I haven't referred to any other resources at the moment.

For the dropdown list event handling, I refered to https://www.w3resource.com/javascript-exercises/event/javascript-event-handling-exercise-2.php
