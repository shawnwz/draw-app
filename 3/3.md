I have broken down the project requirements into tasks for better manageability. My strategic approach involves completing one task per week, allocating around 6-8 hours each week to this project. The task breakdown is designed to align with this time commitment. 

Having a Gantt chart, I've visually represented the timelines for the begin and completion of each task.

As of now, in the first week of January, and I'm pleased to report that I have successfully completed the designated tasks. The project is going smoothly with the schedule.
