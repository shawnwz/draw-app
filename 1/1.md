I have chosen the "draw app" as the foundation for my template due to its suitability for extension, and I anticipate gaining valuable insights from various existing drawing applications. My primary goal is to enhance the user experience by reconfiguring the original app's layout. I intend to relocate diverse button options to the top of the page for easier accessibility. Additionally, I plan to introduce a status bar at the bottom of the page, serving as a dynamic information hub. This status bar will display crucial details such as the current tool name and real-time mouse coordinates, enriching the user's understanding of their actions within the application.

Furthermore, I plan to improve the visual elements by replacing current icons with material, abstract designs. This move towards flatter and more streamlined icons not only aims for a visually pleasing interface but also ensures that users' attention remains focused without unnecessary distractions. The intention is to create a harmonious and visually appealing environment, contributing to an overall improved user experience within the application.

Moving forward, I will introduce several new tools to enhance the app's functionality. These additions include tools for drawing rectangles, inserting text, creating ellipses, and utilizing an eraser and so on. To provide users with even more creative freedom, I will integrate a color picker, allowing them to select any desired color for their artistic endeavors.

One pivotal feature I aim to implement is a global stroke setting. This feature will empower users to establish a consistent stroke size that seamlessly applies to every drawing tool. By enabling users to customize their stroke size globally, I hope to streamline the creative process and maintain a cohesive visual aesthetic throughout their projects.

In order to achieve my goal, I will need to utilize object constructor functions, initialize objects with an array, and manage app-wide variables for configuration and modification.

While these extensions present exciting opportunities to enhance the app's usability and creative potential, I acknowledge potential challenges in implementation. Ensuring a smooth and intuitive user interface, managing the complexity introduced by the new tools, and addressing potential performance considerations will be key areas of focus. However, I am committed to overcoming these challenges to deliver a robust and user-friendly drawing application that caters to both novice and experienced users alike.
